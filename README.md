# Synthetic-Data
Final year project. Working of integration and generation of synthetic to develop AI-Models.
So currently that is on 13th May 2025, we have been able generate synthetic data on gray_sclae images, color images and tablur data. Although color images requrires more raw hardware power to generate, for the final demo howerver the generated images is at a satisfying point. Tabular data and grayscale images are working flawlessly. It nearly took 16 hours for me generate the color images, it's really a painfull experience.
