# Synthetic-Data
Final year project. Working of integration and generation of synthetic to develop AI-Models.
So currently that is on 13th May 2025, we have been able generate synthetic data on gray_sclae images, color images and tablur data. Although color images requrires more raw hardware power to generate, for the final demo howerver the generated images is at a satisfying point. Tabular data and grayscale images are working flawlessly. It nearly took 16 hours for me generate the color images, it's really a painfull experience. Apart from the tensorflow has taken away the access for use the use gpu natively by the release of their new versions, so it's really was a painful experience to generate color images. So the workaround to that was to use Linux systems or windows subsystem for linux, as we might know setting up the whole system would take a lot of time. So instead i opted to run the program natively. And we all might both nvidia and linux hate each other. So there is no proper solution even if i have integrated the whole thing to linux. Nvidia doesn't have proper drivers in linux, so all the changes i might have made, would have been nothing. Apart from that i personally think that the images are really good and if time persists will try to train for 300 or so epochs. Let's wait and see.
